# Installation

## Warning
This is a very early version. 
You will encounter crashes if you put wrong information 
in the settings, because there is no input validation.

## Settings

Setting | Description

Account Name | Your Account
Tab Index | The tab you want to monitor for the chaos recipe

## Filter
You need to prepare your filter, so Chaos Helper can adjust it when needed.  
``# Chaos Helper - Start #``  
``# Chaos Helper - Stop #``  
Add these two tags to your filter and Chaos Helper edits changes between it.

## TODO
- Overlay
- Notification for user to reload the filter
- Input validation
